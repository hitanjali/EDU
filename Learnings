PCB : 
Although we have ground plane on PCB the connection to the gnd pins of ICs should not be a bottelneck. In that case we 
can route the VCC , GND first followed by critical pins like analog , differential and then other pins.

Programming the ATMEGA chips 

1. The chips can be programmed with the help of another arduino board like UNO in the ISP mode. 
   1a. Load the boot loader with the help of ICSP header and another UNO board.

   1b. Now once the boot loader is loaded the chip can be programmed like we do with the FTDI for Promini. 
   
   
2. The chip can be programmed with another programmer like AVR ISP or other programmer and using Arduino IDE.

   Or look at the USBAsp pdf available on Robu.in [ Also in the drive ]

3. Loading of boot loader is optional but in that case the chip works with default fuses if not programmed. 
   Like by default the chip will not take the clock from the external osc and will work with 8MHz div 8 = 1MHz

   So in case of skipping the boot loader we need to take care of loading the required fuses ourselves.
