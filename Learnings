PCB : 
Although we have ground plane on PCB the connection to the gnd pins of ICs should not be a bottelneck. In that case we 
can route the VCC , GND first followed by critical pins like analog , differential and then other pins.

Programming the ATMEGA chips 
========================================================================================================================

1. The chips can be programmed with the help of another arduino board like UNO in the ISP mode. 
   1a. Load the boot loader with the help of ICSP header and another UNO board. 
   
   https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/ArduinoISP#toc7
   
   
   1b. Now once the boot loader is loaded the chip can be programmed like we do with the FTDI for Promini. 
   
   
2. The chip can be programmed with another programmer like AVR ISP or other programmer and using Arduino IDE. 

   https://www.arduino.cc/en/Hacking/Programmer
   https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/projects/breadboarding-and-programming-the-atmega328p-and-attiny45-in-atmel-studio-7/
   Or look at the USBAsp pdf available on Robu.in [ Also in the drive ]

   2a. Programming using USBasp : 
   	-> On windows 8 : 
		Downloaded the Zadig-2.4 , Avrdude [ https://sourceforge.net/projects/winavr ]
		Run Zading , Go to options and select "List all devices" 
		Select the USBasp from the drop down menu
		Select the driver to upload as libusbK(v3.0.7.0) [ Using other drivers it was not possible to program ]
		Push Replaece [ install  ] driver. 
		USBasp will be seen in the "Control Manager" 
   	-> Could program the arduino nano using the USBasp , 10 pin to 6 pin converter , Arduino IDE. 
	-> In Arduino IDE select Toools -> Programmer -> USBasp
	-> Select Tools -> Board -> <board to program > 
	-> Select Tools -> Burn Bootloader 
	OR 
	-> To laod any other sketch 
	-> Select Sketch -> Upload using programmer [ Not just upload ]


	OBSERVATION : Once we upload any sketch using ICSP method the boot loader is erased
	So in order to using the Arduino IDE to load another sketch with the USB port / serial - need to have boot loader on it. 

3. Loading of boot loader is optional but in that case the chip works with default fuses if not programmed. 
   Like by default the chip will not take the clock from the external osc and will work with 8MHz div 8 = 1MHz 
      
   https://www.avrfreaks.net/forum/do-i-need-bootloader-use-my-atmega-328p 
   
   So in case of skipping the boot loader we need to take care of loading the required fuses ourselves. 

 


4. Breadboarded Atmega328p programming :  [Windows with IDE ]

	1. Without any extenal components like 16MHz crystal, 22pf cap , 10K pull up etc. 

	Refer : https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/ArduinoToBreadboard 
	        At the end there is a section related to "Minimal Circuit (Eliminateing external clock )
		
		1a. Download the hardware config file to have "Atmega328 on a breadboard ( 8MHz internal clock )"
		1b. Then in the arduino IDE select Tools -> Boards -> Atmega328 on a breadboard ( 8MHz internal clock )
		1c. Using the USBasp programmer , burn boot loader
		1d. Now remove the power and gnd for the USBasp. 
		1e. Connect power and ground for the FTDI programer. 
		1f. Select the corrrect port. 
		1g. Now download the required code using the same board and using the noraml "upload" [ Not "upload with programmer"]
	
	2. With 16MHz crystal as in the real board. 

	Refer : https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/ArduinoToBreadboard 
		
		1a. Connect the crystal and 22pf Cap , Reset pullup resistor and bypass cap on DTR [ to progrm with the FTDI ]
		1b. Select the board from the Tools -> Boards -> <what ever that uses your UC ] Chose nano.
		1c. Using the USBasp programmer , burn boot loader
		1d. Now remove the power and gnd for the USBasp. 
		1e. Connect power and ground for the FTDI programer. 
		1f. Select the corrrect port. 
		1g. Now download the required code using the same board and using the noraml "upload" [ Not "upload with programmer"]


5.Breadboarded Atmega328p programming :  [ Windows with avrdude command line ]

	1. With 16MHz crystal as in the real board [ with command line and commands ]. 

	Refer : https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/installing-an-arduino-bootloader/all#resources-and-going-further
		Refer the section at the bottom side : Uploding code the hardway

		1a. Open the cmd prompt in windows 

		1b. Use the command file at git hub : 
			https://github.com/hitanjali/EDU/blob/master/usbasp_commands_to_program.txt
		1c. Program the fuse : Please ensure the processor document to confirm which fuses needs to program
			avrdude -b 19200 -c usbasp -p m328p -v -e -U efuse:w:0x05:m -U hfuse:w:0xD2:m -U lfuse:w:0xFF:m

		1d. Generate the hex file from the Arduino IDE :  Sketch -> Export Compiled Library
		    The hex file would be generated in the same folder as the code. 

		1e. For running the avrdude command to upload the hex file, we should be in the same directory as the hex file is. 
	
		1f. Program the hex file : 

			avrdude -b 19200 -c usbasp -p m328p -v -e -U flash:w:<hexfilename>.hex -U lock:w:0x0F:m
			avrdude -b 19200 -c usbasp -p m328p -v -e -U flash:w:Button.ino.eightanaloginputs.hex -U lock:w:0x0F:m


	
6. Breadboarded Atmega328p programming : [ Ubuntu with avrdude command line ]

	1. With 16MHz crystal as in the real board : Same as in windows 



========================================================================================================================
CONCLUSION : 
========================================================================================================================

If we have ISP programmer and we do not need to bootload the controller : 
We can just load the fuese and the program to the UC. 
We just need an ICSP programmer on the board.

Once there is no bootload we can not use serial programming 

We have used USBasp. 
We may even use the Arduino UNO board as ISP programmer. [ Need to verify ]
